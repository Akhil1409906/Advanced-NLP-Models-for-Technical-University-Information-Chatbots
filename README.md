# Advanced NLP Models for Technical University Information Chatbots

This project creates a chatbot that uses advanced NLP techniques to provide accurate and context-aware responses to queries related to technical university information. It leverages NLTK for text processing, JSON files for structured data storage, and Flask to build the web interface. The chatbot is powered by a neural network trained to understand and respond to questions related to courses, admissions, faculty, and campus facilities.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Natural Language Processing (NLP) with NLTK
- Flask (Web Framework)
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (Frontend)
- Neural Networks (AI)
- JSON (Data Storage)

## Features
- Query processing and response generation using NLP techniques.
- Structured data storage in JSON files to store and retrieve university information.
- Frontend built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for an interactive user experience.
- Flask backend to serve the chatbot and handle user interactions.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
1. Install Python (>=3.6) from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
